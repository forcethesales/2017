Conversation with their support

Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:26:11 PM): Welcome! I'm Kaleena and Iâ€™ll be right with you. 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:26:15 PM): Thanks! 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:27:36 PM): Hi there, You could use the object alias %%SFA_LEAD%% to pass the id you create in the first form to the second form: https://help.formassembly.com/help/344494-object-alias 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:28:52 PM): ok. can you tell me where to use that? 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:29:12 PM): Yes, are you using a redirect URL to go from the first form to the second one? 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:29:33 PM): I'm not sure. I was going to use a workflow. 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:30:25 PM): Okay, in the workflow then you would put it in the area where you pass values from one form to the next: https://help.formassembly.com/help/workflows#pass-data-between-forms 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:30:51 PM): ooh i like it. 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:31:20 PM): You'll need to make sure the Salesforce connector is in the form submitted stage in order for this to work though. It can't be in the after form submitted stage 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:31:24 PM): tfa_1=%%SFA_LEAD%% 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:31:29 PM): Yep :) 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:31:51 PM): okay, can do. 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:31:57 PM): can you hang out while I try it? 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:32:08 PM): Of course 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:34:42 PM): oh do I need to build in a redirect link on the Notification Options of form 1? 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:35:02 PM): You could either do that, or use a workflow. They would both work 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:35:21 PM): I tend to prefer the redirect URL because it's more versatile 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:36:19 PM): so I turned on the workflow, but after submitting form 1, I get a thank you page 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:37:56 PM): Are you accessing the workflow from this URL https://app.formassembly.com/workflows/start/3311 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:38:01 PM): nope! 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:38:06 PM): lemme try that 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:38:28 PM): I have to change my url to include the pre-fill section, yes? 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:38:38 PM): yes 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:39:56 PM): the lead id did not populate on page 2 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:39:57 PM): https://app.formassembly.com/workflows/edit/3311 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:40:37 PM): You need to use all capital letters in the object alias, %%SFA_LEAD%% 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:42:32 PM): awesome. that worked 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:42:40 PM): now let me make sure I can get the pre-fill stuff correct. 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:42:42 PM): Sweet! 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:45:13 PM): I see that at some point I did this before 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:45:19 PM): so I have this url to start the process: 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:45:28 PM): https://www.tfaforms.com/forms/view/457702/?tfa_dbWorkflowId=3311&tfa_dbWorkflowStep=0&tfa_dbWorkflowControl=f8ee74b1a4f9978b192ea59144ba704c&userid=' + UserID; 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:45:46 PM): what is this part: tfa_dbWorkflowControl=f8ee74b1a4f9978b192ea59144ba704c 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:46:10 PM): That directs it to the correct workflow 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:46:35 PM): So the data will go to the correct place 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:47:07 PM): how do I find that id for this form? 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:47:11 PM): or this workflow 
Kaleena P (5/18/2017, 3:48:37 PM): When you start the workflow you should see it in the address bar. It appears to be: https://app.formassembly.com/forms/view/457702/?tfa_dbWorkflowId=3311&tfa_dbWorkflowStep=0&tfa_dbWorkflowControl=0dcda79ff5227136986f96463f3b1868 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:52:44 PM): ok! Thank you. that definitely works 
Me (5/18/2017, 3:52:48 PM): i am all set
